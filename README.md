#Explaination
Would wait for 5 sceonds ,checks if pixels at boundary box on screen were black ,then ‘Shift+ctrl+r ‘ are pressed to reload,this continues until video plays  

Would be better on c, but fuck yeah python I choose you .

a plugin or web extention would be more relevant instead of a script

#Installation:-

Sudo apt-get install python

Sudo apt-get install python-pip

Create a venv (recommended ),

pip install pyautogui

pip install pillow 

Dont use easy_install instead of pip,presuming your python verison is older than 2.7
